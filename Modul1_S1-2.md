# Module 1: Cloud Concepts Overview

## Section 1: Introduction to Cloud Computing

### Definition
- On-demand delivery of:
  - Compute power  
  - Database  
  - Storage  
  - Applications  
  - Other IT resources  
- Delivered **via the internet** with **pay-as-you-go pricing**.  
- Shifts infrastructure from **hardware** to **software usage**.  

---

### Traditional Computing Model
- **Infrastructure = Hardware**
- Characteristics of hardware solutions:  
  - Require physical space, staff, and security  
  - Long procurement cycles  
  - High upfront capital expenditure (CapEx)  
  - Capacity planning based on theoretical peak usage (often inaccurate)  

---

### Cloud Computing Model
- **Infrastructure = Software**
- Characteristics of software solutions:  
  - Flexible and scalable  
  - Faster, easier, more cost-effective changes  
  - Eliminate undifferentiated heavy-lifting tasks  

---

### Cloud Service Models
- **IaaS** – Infrastructure as a Service (highest control)  
- **PaaS** – Platform as a Service (less control)  
- **SaaS** – Software as a Service (least control)  

---

### Deployment Models
- **Cloud (Public Cloud)**  
- **Hybrid Cloud**  
- **On-premises (Private Cloud)**  

---

### Key Components
- **Security**: Security Groups, Network ACLs, IAM (authentication & authorization)  
- **Networking**: Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon VPC  
- **Compute**: AMI (Amazon Machine Images), EC2 Instances  
- **Storage & Databases**: EBS, EFS, S3, RDS

## Section 2: Advantages of Cloud Computing

1. **Trade capital expense for variable expense**  
   - No upfront data center investment  
   - Pay only for what you use  

2. **Massive economies of scale**  
   - AWS aggregates demand across customers  
   - Lower costs passed on to users  

3. **Stop guessing capacity**  
   - No over-provisioning (wasted cost)  
   - No under-provisioning (performance issues)  
   - Scale on demand  

4. **Increase speed and agility**  
   - Traditional: Weeks/months to provision resources  
   - Cloud: Minutes to get resources  

5. **Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers**  

6. **Go global in minutes**  
   - Deploy workloads across multiple regions instantly
